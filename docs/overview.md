# Overview

Lunascope offers a modular interface composed of multiple synchronized panels ("docks").

![Overview](imgs/p1b.png)

The central signal viewer will always be present.  All other docks can
be hidden or shown, either by the top menu, clicking the 'close' icons
on each dock, by key-board short-cuts, or by a [config](config.md) file.

Each dock (Parameters, Signals, Annotations, Spectrograms, Hypnograms, etc.)
can be detached or re-positioned to match your workflow.

## Keyboard shortcuts

On Windows and Linux `C` implies the _Control_ key;  on macOS, `C` implies the _Command_ key.
