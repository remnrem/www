# Sleep

## Why sleep?

In the course of his or her life, the average person sleeps for more
than 25 years. Despite major advances in understanding the circadian and homeostatic
factors that regulate sleep, much remains unknown about its functions
— that is, why we sleep. Sleep is believed to
play important roles across a broad range of processes, including
memory consolidation, neuroprotective actions, hormonal function, and
interactions with the cardiovascular and immune systems. Nonetheless,
in many ways 'sleep' currrently remains an umbrella term for a
heterogeneous set of interacting processes that need to be better
characterized and understood.

## Individual differences in sleep

People vary considerably in their typical quality and quantity of
sleep. On one level, brain activity as measured by the
electroencephalogram (EEG) is a heritable 'fingerprint', aspects of
which correlate with a range of clinical, demographic and cognitive
variables. On another level, individuals suffering from disorders of
sleep (including sleep apnea, insomnia, hypersomnia and narcolepsy)
can exhibit markedly aberrant sleep patterns.
The genetic basis of most of this clinically meaningful variability is largely unknown, however.


## Sleep and health

Individual differences in sleep (especially lack of sleep) have been
associated with a host of chronic medical conditions
including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and ultimately shortened life expectancy.
For some disorders (e.g. major depressive
disorder and bipolar disorder) sleep problems are core clinical
features.
The direction of these associations is typically unclear.
Do sleep problems lead to disease, or disease to abnormal
sleep?
Or does a third factor — such as a shared genetic basis — give rise
to both sleep and health phenotypes? Delineating these types of
causal networks will be important
because it may provide a basis for identifying targets for intervention and patient stratification.


## Current projects

This is a non-exhaustive list of recent and ongoing projects (primarily
computational tool and methods development) and collaborations (applying
these tools to existing or new data collections led by others):

### Data, tools and methods

 - __National Sleep Research Resource__: working with founding-member
Dr. Susan Redline, Dr. Purcell co-directs the [NSRR](https://sleepdata.org), an NLBI-funded
respository or sleep research data

 - __Luna__: we are devloping a growing [library of
tools](https://zzz.nyspi.org/luna) designed to work with large numbers
of sleep studies, with a current focus on the sleep EEG

 - __Personalized sleep staging__: Dr. Purcell is the PI of an NHLBI-funded R01
to support the development of methods to better capture
between-individual variability in automated sleep staging, and to
define new quantitative metrics, beyond traditional classification of
sleep stages, to better capture individual differences in sleep

 - __Dynamics__: Dr. Purcell is the PI of an NHLBI-funded R21 to develop methods
to better capture ultradian dynamics in sleep signals (patterns of
change within a single night)




### Sleep neurophysiology, psychiatric disease and genetics

 - __MARS: Mood and Rhythms of Sleep__: This project is a newly awarded,
Wellcome Trust funded project to develop sleep-based objective
biomarkers for bipolar disorder and major depression.

 - __The role of cerebellar cortical and thalamocortical circuits in
bipolar disorder__: with Dr. Jen Pan (Broad Institute) and others, this
new and highly multidiscplinary project funded by Breakthrough
Discoveries for thriving with Bipolar Disorder (BD2) will investigate
the role of gene-driven dysfunction within key brain structures to
create a framework for validating targets identified in human genetic
studies and potentially uncover specific therapeutic opportunities for
carriers of those risk factors.

 - __GRINS__: the Global Research Initiative on the Neurophysiology of
Schizophrenia is a collaboration with investigators at the Stanley
Center, Broad Institute and Wuxi Mental Health Center (China), as well
as other investigators at Mass General and McLean Hospitals. This
project focuses on collecting high density sleep EEG and other
measures in patients with schizophrenia and matched controls.

 - __Animal models__: in collaboration with Dr. Jen Pan at the Stanley
Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute, and others, we are
studying the effects of human mutations associated with psychiatric
disease, in vivo in the sleep EEG.  Sleep EEG GWAS: leveraging
genetically informative datasets in the NSRR, we aim to perform
genome-wide association studies to link objective measures of sleep
macro- and micro-architecture with genetic risk for psychiatric
disease.



### Sleep and cognitive aging

 - __MESA/MrOS__: working with collaborators from the MESA and MrOS studies,
we have characterized multiple facets of sleep macro and micro
archtiecture in almost 4,000 older adults, showing how they change
with age and predict cognitive performance.
Next, we will focus longitudinally to examine changes in sleep and cognition over multiple years.


 - __Harvard Aging Brain Study__: in a collaboration led by Jasmeer Chatwal
and others, we will be investigating sleep neurophysiological metrics
in relation to PET imaging markers of cognitive aging.

 - __Contributions of sleep to preclinical and clinical AD__: we will be
collaborating on a new study led by Drs. Jayandra Himali and Matthew
Pase, on the links between sleep, brain morphometry and other imaging
measures.


### Sleep and cognitive development

 - __RASP and ESP studies__: these ongoing projects aim to compile pediatric
sleep studies, either using retrospective clinical studies, or
prospectively collecting research studies, in order to evaluate the
degree to which the development and maturation of sleep patterns
relate to neurodevelopmental differences in young children. This is a
multi-site collaboration with NIMH Intramural researchers and other
sites (Boston Children's, Geisinger, New York University, Baylor
College of Medicine).

 - __NIMH toddlers study__: we collaborate with NIMH intramural researchers
Drs. Ashura Buckley and Audrey Thurm, looking at how the sleep EEG of
very young children predicts cognitive development.

 - __Sleep and cognitive development in children__: we are characterizing
developmental changes in the sleep EEG, with a focus on functional
connectivity indexed by coherence analysis.


### Sleep epidemiology and health

 - __Sleep, race and health disparities__: working with collaborators at
Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. Purcell is PI of a NIMHD-funded
R21 to better determine which aspects of sleep may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes

 - __Normative studies for sleep biomarkers__: if objective sleep metrics are
ever to be used as clinically useful biomarkers, it will be important
to first characterize baseline sources of variability in these
measures, to identify unbiased and reliable measures. This involves
studying sleep biomarkers in large and diverse datasets, following our
work on sleep spindles, for example.
