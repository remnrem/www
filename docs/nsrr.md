# National Sleep Research Resource

The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) is a web portal
([http://sleepdata.org](https://sleepdata.org)) that hosts a number of
datasets from studies of sleep.  Most datasets include polysomnography
as well as demographic, biomedical, questionnaire and other
measures. Along with founder Dr. Susan Redline, Dr. Purcell co-directs
this resource, which is supported by an NHLBI contract.

__If you have sleep data you'd like to share, or if you've developed
tools for the analysis of sleep data, please contact us.__
