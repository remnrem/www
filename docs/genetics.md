# Psychiatric genetics

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful tool for
mapping the genetic bases of complex traits. We have made several
methodological and substantive contributions to the GWAS literature,
including the [PLINK](http://zzz.nyspi.org/plink) software package and
multiple applications in psychiatric genetics.
Future goals include genetic research using EEG-based sleep studies to shed light on the role of sleep oscillations in mediating genetic risk for psychiatric disease.


## Areas of previous work in human genetics

 - polygenic models of complex disease
 - copy number variation
 - rare variants and sequencing studies
 - gene set enrichment and integrative analyses
 - ancestry and identity-by-descent
 - pleiotropy in complex trait genetics
 - genetic risk prediction
 - twin studies and quantitative genetics

## Psychiatric genetics projects and collaborations

 - __Psychiatric Genomics Consortium__ - the [PGC](http://pgc.unc.edu/) is a large international
consortium pursuing genome-wide analyses of common psychiatric
disease including [schizophrenia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21926974), [bipolar disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21926972), autism, ADHD and
[major depressive disorder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22472876).

- __Bipolar Sequencing Consortium__ - the goal of the BSC is to identify
genetic variants that influence risk of bipolar disorder, by bringing
together rare variant sequencing studies from both population-based
and family-based studies.  

- __De novo mutation in schizophrenia__ - collaboration with researchers
from University of Cardiff, Wales, the Stanley Center for Psychiatric
Research and others, analysis of a family-based sample of
schizophrenia patients from Bulgaria.

- __International Schizophrenia Consortium__ - in many ways a precursor to
the PGC, the ISC involved researchers from over a dozen institutions who
collaborated to perform large-scale genome-wide studies of
schizophrenia. We published two prominent manuscripts describing our
primary work, on the roles of common SNPs ([PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19571811) | [PDF](http://zzz.nyspi.org/library/isc-2009.pdf)) and rare copy
number variants ([PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18668038) | [PDF](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/library/isc-2008.pdf)) in predisposing to the disease (media
