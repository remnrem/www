## Current affiliation and goals

Dr. Shaun Purcell is a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry,
Columbia University Irving Medical Center and a Research Scientist at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute. His current focus is on understanding
the links between sleep, behavior, cognition, and
psychiatric disease using human genetic and computational approaches,
with the ultimate goal of enabling precision medicine and targeted
interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Academic background

Dr. Purcell's first degrees were in [Experimental Psychology](http://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/), from the
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) and [University of London](http://www.lon.ac.uk)
([UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk)); his PhD was from the
[SGDP](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/mrc/index.aspx),
[Institute of Psychiatry](http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk),
[KCL](http://www.kcl.ac.uk), under the mentorship of
[Pak Sham](http://www.psychiatry.hku.hk/p_sham.html).
After completing a Fellowship at the
[Whitehead Institute](http://wi.mit.edu)
(sponsored by the [UK Medical Research Council](http://www.mrc.ac.uk)),
he joined the Psychiatric & Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit
([PNGU](http://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/research/pngu_home.aspx))
at Massachusetts General Hospital
([MGH](http://www.mgh.harvard.edu)) in Boston.

A major focus of Dr. Purcell’s earlier work was neuropsychiatric genetics,
including work with colleagues at the [Stanley Center for Psychiatric
Research](http://www.broad.mit.edu/psych/stanley/) at the [Broad
Institute of Harvard and MIT](http://www.broad.mit.edu). His research centered on developing statistical and computational
tools for the design of genetic studies (including the
[PLINK](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/) software package), the
detection of gene variants influencing complex human traits, and the
dissection of these effects in the larger context of other genetic and
environmental factors.  Together with collaborators, he contributed to
multiple landmark genome-wide association and exome-sequencing
[studies of neuropsychiatric disease](pubs.md).

Dr. Purcell’s current projects are primarily focused on sleep neurophysiology and psychiatric disease.
In this, he collaborates closely with
members of the [Division of Sleep and Circadian
Disorders](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/sleep-and-circadian-disorders/overview)
and the [Sleep Epidemiology and
Medicine](https://sleep.med.harvard.edu/research/labs/101/Sleep+Medicine+Epidemiology+Program)
at [Brigham & Women's Hospital](http://www.brighamandwomens.org), [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu).
